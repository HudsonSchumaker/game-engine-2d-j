/**
 * Frame-based game loop is the easiest implementation. The loop always keeps spinning
 * for the following three processes: processInput, update and render. The problem with
 * it is you have no control over how fast the game runs. On a fast machine, that loop
 * will spin so fast users won’t be able to see what’s going on. On a slow machine, the
 * game will crawl. If you have a part of the game that’s content-heavy or does more AI
 * or physics, the game will actually play slower there.
